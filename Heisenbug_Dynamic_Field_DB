Heisenbug Dynamic Field Database
- Environment: 10.1, docker, .env => .docker_compose_env_http_selenium
- Config:
  - Server: db
  - Database: otobo
  - User: otobo
  - Password: otobo-docker-databasepw
  - Table: queue
  - Identifier: id
  - Label: id
  - Datatype: Integer
  - Search Field and List Field enabled
  - Assigned the Dynamic Field to CustomerTicketMessage as not required
- What happened?
  - Typing single digit numbers into the Dynamic Field provoked two empty suggestions and an error: "Can't connect to MySQL Server on 'db' (115)", even detailed search showed no results
  - Adding the "name" attribute in the config (Identifier name, Label name, Datatype Text) enabled the search to work correctly (detailed search not tested)
  - After removing the "name" attribute again, it keeped working correctly, even an samely configured new Dynamic Database Field
